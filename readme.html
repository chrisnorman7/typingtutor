<h1>Welcome to Typing Tutor</h1>
<h2>Written by Chris Norman, the creator of <a href="www.guitarbytouch.com">Guitar By Touch</a>.</h2>
<p>This program aims to be simple and fun, and allows you to practise your typing.</P.
<p>Exercises are simply written as text files, requiring you to type each letter correctly before moving on.</p>
<p>You are timed for each exercise, and your time, as well as how many letters you mistyped are shown at the end.</p>
<p>If you would like to make your own exercises, simply create them as text files, and (for ease of use), put them in the exercises sub directory of the main program folder.</p>
